# Cancer Prediction Project: Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
## Project Overview
This project explores two types of machine learning algorithms: **supervised learning** and **unsupervised learning**. The goal is to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant using a given dataset. We evaluate the performance of both types of learning algorithms and determine which approach is more suitable for this dataset.
Kullanılan Algoritmalar
Denetimli Öğrenme: Lojistik Regresyon, Destek Vektör Makinesi (SVM) vb.
Denetimsiz Öğrenme: K-Means Kümeleme, Temel Bileşenler Analizi (PCA) vb.
## Results
- **Supervised Learning Results:**
  -Model Accuracy: 97%
  -Precision: 0.96 (for class 0), 0.98 (for class 1)
  -Recall: 0.99 (for class 0), 0.94 (for class 1)
  -F1-Score: 0.98 (for class 0), 0.96 (for class 1)

- **Unsupervised Learning Results:**
  - Clustering Accuracy: X%
  - Cluster Distribution: [Benign: X, Malignant: X]

 ### Conclusion
After running both supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, we observed the following:
- **Supervised Learning** showed better performance with higher accuracy and more reliable predictions.
- **Unsupervised Learning**, Encountered difficulties in fully implementing the unsupervised learning algorithm in the project.
